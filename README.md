# 🚀 Ransonware Classifier | TRM Labs Extra mile
___

### 🔹 **About this project**:

This is a classifier to identify possible ransomware in Bitcoin transactions, based on a dataset called 'Bitcoin Heist', which can be found at this link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gopalmahadevan/bitcoin-heist-ransomware-address-dataset.

I chose this dataset because I wanted to research something that TRM Labs would be working on, based on their products and business focus. Ransomware is a problem in BTC transactions, and government organisations can take years to define addresses that may be criminal. This project seeks to help the FBI and such organisations identify malicious transactions faster and more efficiently based on Data Science.

### 🔹 **My aspirations for this project**:

This project was developed specifically for the Data Scientist position at TRM Labs. My objective in working on this project is to demonstrate my skills in the field of data science, as well as my enthusiasm and commitment to this position, I'm eager for this opportunity and I really wanted to show this with this project.

**The development of this project did not seek any deep usage of Data Science, but a VERY simple solution to real world problem, focusing on results and evidencing skills in data science and problem solving.**


> **Folders**:

>📁 data: Folder containing all the datasets [may be empty due to file size] <br>
📁 doc: Documentation of all MD files <br>
📁 EDA: All notebooks, from analysing the data to analysing the problem and EDA. <br>
📁 Models: The ML model saved in a pickle file. <br>
📁 src: Model development and results. <br>
📁 trm_dashboard: Dashboard of results and real-time transactions [Not using real data or data from the data folder in this repository]. <br>
>📁 utils <br>

### 🔹 **Evaluation**:

This code can be replicated, but for a very simple direct results for the solution you can look at the index.html file where all the information about the solution is concentrated there.
